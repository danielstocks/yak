# Yak


Yak is an ORM that maps REST resources to JavaScript models/collections.

Inspired by [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Her](http://www.her-rb.org/), Yak is designed to build applications that are powered by a RESTful JSON API instead of a database. Yak uses `window.fetch` on the client, and
`node-fetch` on the server, which makes it really easy for you to write a peristance layer in an isomorphic fashion. 

Usage documentation can be found at http://webcloud.se/yak
